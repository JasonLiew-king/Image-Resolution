# Image Resolution
This repository implements **SRCNN (Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network)**, a deep learning model that enhances low-resolution images using convolutional layers, and **SRGAN (Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network)**, a GAN-based approach for generating high-resolution images with realistic textures through adversarial training.
